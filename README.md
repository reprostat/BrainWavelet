# BrainWavelet Toolbox
## Description
The BrainWavelet Toolbox implements wavelet despiking, seed correlational testing and probabilistic graph construction, as described in [Patel and Bullmore, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.04.052).

## Disclaimer
This GitHub repository is a convenience store of the last version of the toolbox as it was available at http://www.brainwavelet.org, which is not available anymore.
